When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you would like to share it to others or for accessing the code from
    another machine

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    This will give me the power to pull changes from github and merging them
    when the time come because automatic pulls might disrupt my workflow

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks is something like cloning but it only exists in GitHub whereas cloning 
    happens between GitHub and the Git desktop client. Branches in the other hand
    is used to split the project into another direction

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Will be able to work on the repository changes while being offline and 
    also i can also merge the changes once i'm done 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would collaborate using github as it is an online service opposed to git
    being a local service and sharing on github is just a link share away

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Commiting changes into another branch will enable me to push out certain parts
    of the code first rather than updating the entire program and it'll also
    reduce the risk of buggy commits on the master branch
